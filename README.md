# hentoid-contentv2-maker
Python GUI for making contentv2's for Hentoid

This exists as a Proof of Concept to show that someone can make the data needed for Hentoid to read manually. In its current state it reads the image files in a directory, you apply any tags you need, and it provides a relevant contentv2.json that you can place into the book folder.

For batch / mass editing please refer to https://github.com/fuwamocoanon/hentoid-contentV2-gens which works for Anchira yaml and HentaiNexus json files.
